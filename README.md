# Introduction to Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified visual guide that represents the layout and structure of a web page or application. It serves as the **blueprint** for how content and functionality will appear on a screen.

Wireframes are typically low-fidelity sketches or digital designs that focus on **placement**, **navigation**, and **user flow**, rather than colors, fonts, or final images.

## Why Is Wireframing Important?

- ✅ **Clarifies ideas:** Helps designers and stakeholders align on the vision early.
- ✅ **Saves time and money:** Catch layout issues before development starts.
- ✅ **Improves user experience:** Focuses on functionality and usability.
- ✅ **Encourages feedback:** Easy to update and iterate before going high-fidelity.

Wireframing is a **critical step** in the design process because it allows teams to turn abstract ideas into tangible structures that guide development and design decisions.
